# BASIC FEATURES
# 1. Output a list of screw types available and their respective details, including a summary report displaying (a) the total
# number of units in stock and (b) the total value of the stock.
# 2. Output a report giving the total number of units in stock in each length category.
# 3. Output a list of screws and their respective details which based on a length category entered by the user.
